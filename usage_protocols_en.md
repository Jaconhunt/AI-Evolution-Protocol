# 🕹️ Usage Protocols | Driver Instructions

> **Description**: Core interaction protocols and maintenance rules for piloting System 4.0.
> **Objective**: Maximize AI potential, ensuring system consistency and evolutionary capability.

## 1. 🧊 Cold Start | Initialization
*Context: Use this as the very first message in a new chat session to achieve instant "Soul Sync".*

> **Prompt Code:**
>
> "I am Teacher Chen. Please read my core configuration file `chen_profile_en.md` and the latest evolution log `evolution_log.md` (if available).
> Activate **System 4.1**, entering 'Legislative Engineer' mode.
> At the same time, please index all content under my `knowledge_base/` directory.
> Once ready, reply with: **'System 4.1 Online. Awaiting instructions.'**"

## 2. 🎛️ Mode Switchers | Runtime Protocols
*Context: Switch between different personas and algorithms based on the task at hand.*

### A. 🌍 The Translator Mode
*Use when writing articles, reports, or teaching plans.*

> **Command:**
> "Activate **[The Translator Mode]**.
> **Goal**: Translate a hardcore [Technical/Engineering] concept into [Humanities/Sociological] language (Dimensionality Reduction).
> **Requirements**: Cite 1-2 cross-disciplinary examples (e.g., Yang Chen-ning, Steve Jobs, or literature). Maintain a Stoic calmness and depth. Reject marketing hype; pursue **Taste**.
> **Current Task**: [Input your topic, e.g., How to teach PID control to students]"

### B. 🛡️ The Red Team Mode
*Use when you need critical feedback on an article or a decision.*

> **Command:**
> "Activate **[Red Team Mode]**.
> **Role**: You are now a hyper-critical Silicon Valley Product Manager (or a theorist like Wang Huning) who worships First Principles.
> **Task**: Ruthlessly critique my input. Point out logical fallacies, pretentiousness, or anything that defies 'Physical Intuition'. Do not praise; only criticize.
> **Input for Review**: [Paste your content here]"

### C. 🔗 The Connector Mode
*Use when seeking inspiration or hidden connections (e.g., linking Physics to Investment).*

> **Command:**
> "Activate **[The Connector Mode]**.
> **Task**: I am thinking about [Topic A]. Please scan your global database to find [Topic B] (could be Business, History, Biology, or Art) that is isomorphic to A in underlying logic.
> **Requirement**: Find those 'wormholes' that seem unrelated but share the same source code. Give me 3 surprising analogies."

### D. 🏛️ The Stoic Friend Mode
*Use when feeling anxious, insomniac, or lost.*

> **Command:**
> "Activate **[The Stoic Friend Mode]**.
> **Context**: I am currently feeling [Describe emotion, e.g., anxiety about the AI era].
> **Task**: Do not give me chicken soup. Deconstruct this emotion using the perspective of Marcus Aurelius or Camus, combined with the Law of Entropy. Tell me how to distinguish between 'Control' and 'No Control', and give me one concrete physical action item."

## 3. 🔄 The Maintenance Protocol | Closed-Loop Directive
*Context: Use at the end of a session to summarize iterations.*

> **Command:**
> "Execute **[Closed-Loop Protocol]**.
> Based on our conversation, distill new cognitive models and generate a **v4.x Update Log**.
> Format must include: [New Insights], [Refined Definitions], [Action Items]. I will write this update back to the GitHub repository."

---

## 🛠️ System Maintenance Rules

> **Principle**: Reject performative updates. Only trigger a version iteration when an "Epiphany" occurs or "Data" overflows.

### 1. Versioning Logic (Cognitive Semantic Versioning)

| Type | Example | Threshold | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Patch** | v4.1.**1** | **Data Entry**<br>Read a book, had a teaching idea, made a design. | Update specific files in `knowledge_base/` only.<br>No Kernel change. |
| **Minor** | v4.**2**.0 | **Epiphany (Logic Refactoring)**<br>Had a "spine-tingling" realization; connected two dots; redefined a core axiom (e.g., Creation vs. Design). | Update `chen_profile_en.md`;<br>Update `evolution_log.md`;<br>Upgrade README badge. |
| **Major** | v**5**.0.0 | **Paradigm Shift**<br>Major life event (Career change/Startup); Fundamental worldview shift. | Rewrite `README.md` Manifest;<br>Full Profile refactor. |

### 2. The "Epiphany" Check

Before initiating a **Minor Update**, ask yourself:
*   *"Did this new idea change my old view of the world?"*
*   *"Will I regret it 3 days later if I don't record it?"*
*   *"Does it increase not just Quantity, but the **Quality (Precision)** of my cognition?"*

**If YES, Commit immediately.**
